# Ultimate Django Course Project by MOSH

This repository contains the comprehensive project I completed as part of the "Ultimate Django Course" by Mosh. The course provided a deep dive into Django, one of the most popular web frameworks for Python, and equipped me with the skills to build dynamic web applications efficiently. Throughout the course, we explored various aspects of Django, integrated multiple databases, and implemented tools for enhancing performance and scalability.

## Key Highlights:

- **Database Integration**: We integrated multiple database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more, allowing me to understand the flexibility of Django when working with different data storage solutions.

- **Efficiency with Celery**: To optimize application performance, we leveraged Celery, a distributed task queue, for asynchronous processing and background jobs.

- **Redis Integration**: Redis played a key role in enhancing application speed and efficiency. We learned how to utilize Redis for caching and session management.

- **Dockerization**: The project is Dockerized, allowing for easy setup and deployment in various environments. Docker ensures that the application runs consistently, regardless of the host system.

- **A Deep Dive into Django**: The "Ultimate Django Course" was a comprehensive exploration of Django's core components, including models, views, templates, and forms. This understanding enabled us to create complex and feature-rich web applications.

## Project Structure:

- **`storefront/`**: This directory contains the main Django application.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the project's Python dependencies for easy installation.

- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the Docker container for the application.

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: The Docker Compose configuration for running the application and its required services.

- **`celeryconfig.py`**: Configuration file for Celery tasks.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Use Docker and Docker Compose to set up and run the application in your desired environment.

Feel free to explore the code and the various components I implemented during the course. This project serves as a testament to my journey through the "Ultimate Django Course" and showcases my ability to work with Django, integrate databases, optimize performance, and leverage tools like Celery and Docker for a robust web application.
